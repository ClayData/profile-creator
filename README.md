# profile-creator
This app uses node.js to create a profile of based on data about a user from github. Packages used in this application are Inquirer, axios and html-pdf. Using node to start the program in the terminal, a user enters in their username and the color they want the background of the cards produced to be. The question prompts come from inquirer. An axios call is then made to the github api with the username given. This returns all of the information displayed in the pdf except for the exact star count. The first axios call provides a starred url that can be used in another axios call to retrieve the number of starred repos. With all of the necessary returned information then put in variables a template literal of an html file is used with the variables. This template literal is used in the html-pdf function to create a pdf file of what the webpage looks like.
